# MessagingApp-Kotlin-
Title says it all

This Repo is for my mesasing app. I used Firebase for authentication, Messaging, and image storage.  I plan on adding more changes to it over time. It's not meant to be released or anything, just for practice. App development is fun right now. 

# Here are quick gif snapshots of the app.
